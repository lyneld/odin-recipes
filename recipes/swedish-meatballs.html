    <em>Swedish meatball sauce is made up of just a few pantry staple ingredients</em>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A rich and creamy Swedish meatball sauce makes a comforting meal when served over pre-cooked meatballs. This quick and easy recipe makes a generous amount of sauce for 10 ounces of frozen meatballs. Serve over egg noodles or rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed, or more to taste</li>
        <li>10 ounces frozen cooked meatballs, thawed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together stock, cream, flour, soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon rosemary in a large saucepan over low heat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in thawed meatballs, and continue cooking until meatballs are heated through, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meatballs should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</li>
    </ol>
